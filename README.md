# What Do I Do – Backend

_A community-driven way to make better decisions._

**What Do I Do** is a collaborative decision-making platform where users can ask for help when facing choices. Instead of traditional Q&A, questions are posted as **decision polls**, allowing the community to vote and share their perspectives.

The frontend, built with **React + TypeScript**, powers the core functionality of the platform, making it possible for users to:

- **Post decision polls** – Ask a question framed around a choice, with multiple possible options to consider.
- **Vote on options** – Other users can cast their votes to show what they think is the best path forward.
- **Engage in collective decision-making** – By combining votes and feedback, the app helps users gain insight and feel more confident in making decisions.

The project is designed to encourage **interaction, community input, and constructive guidance**. Whether someone is deciding on a big life choice, a small everyday question, or simply looking for outside perspectives, _What Do I Do_ provides a simple yet meaningful way to gather advice.

This repository contains the **frontend component** of the application, which handles the logic, data flow, and user interactions that make the platform possible.
